<!-- ### About Me -->
I am passionate about building large-scale,
intelligent systems for solving real world problems. I am currently
pursuing my MS in Computer Science at Stony Brook University. My
objective for graduate studies is two-fold:

1. Developing strong theoretical understanding of Machine Learning
   algorithms, Probability Theory and Optimisation.
2. Proficiency in analysing and programming parallel/distributed algorithms.

I believe such a skill set would enable me to design and develop
scalable, intelligent solutions to real world problems.

Under the guidance of
Prof. [Minh Hoai](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~minhhoai/) I am
currently investigating techniques for performing video captioning -
given an input video, can we develop a machine (deep) learning model
that can output a sentence description for the video content? More
generally, I am interested in all things at the intersection of
computer vision and natural language processing.

Prior to joining Stony Brook University, I have 2 years of work
(start-up) experience in building deep learning solutions - object
detection for e-commerce, chat bots, cheque processing - to solve real
world problems.
